## Explanation
The main time I took while completing this project was in styling the application to make it look good, everything else was easy to get through. I first spend some time trying see what packages I will need for the project and how I want the final product to look like. Once I got a basic design I worked on skeleton code of todo list screen, then moved on to styling it so it looked somewhat nice, after the styling was done I went to implementing the functionalites like adding a new todo, updating/removing the todo, searching for the todos which all that took about 40 minutes. I then moved on to working on the login screen, and applied the same concept as todo list screen, working on skeleton, styling, and then adding functionalites such as login and logout. Once those were done I spend some time in api request to authenticate the user which took about 15 minutes. The final step was to implement all the error/validation of the email/password fields and make the final styling, the login screen took about 35 minutes, all together about 1 hour and 35 minutes.
